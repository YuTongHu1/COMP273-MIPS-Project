# MIPS-CPU
COMP 273 project: Designed and implemented a project simulating various hardware components during CPU operation, demonstrating proficiency in low-level programming and computer architecture concepts 

## Project Status
This system simulates various hardware components during CPU operations using MIPS. While the project is functional to an extent, it is not fully complete and may contain unresolved issues.

## Context
This project was originally designed to be completed in pairs during Fall 2022 semester in COMP273. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I undertook and completed the project independently.

## Files Included
Final Submission: Revised version submitted for grading and README file

## Acknowledgments
Despite the challenges of working solo, this project has been a valuable learning experience in understanding MIPS programming and computer architecture.
