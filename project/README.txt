Hi, I had an extension till Sunday midnight. 

I used the teacher's solution A5 where write=0, read=1. 
To make sure the program is working properly, 
please turn ON the mode register by hand everytime before you start the clock, 
or else it will override the data in RAM row 0 (since write = 0)

There are probably bugs around, I apologies for that in advance.
I lost electricity for a moment this afternoon and since I was working on my computer, I lost big part of my progress (I thought it would auto save, but seems like it doesn't)

Again, please don't forget to turn on the mode register by hand, before the clock is started!
Sorry for the trouble!
